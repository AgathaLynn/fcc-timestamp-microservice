So... I understand that this isn't really the purpose of a README, but for right now this is just going to be my notes to myself. 
Doesn't matter much *where* I put that, at least not right now, but I should probably have it.  And now I've actually started the project...

Go me.  

...And, now I'm stuck again.  Next step, I think, it taking a side-trip to figure out Git. (Because I need to figure out how to get this and my github repository synced, and because I need to figure out how to use git.)  But that's tomorrow.
