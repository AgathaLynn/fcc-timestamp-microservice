### FCC Timestamp Microservice

This project is my implementation of FreeCodeCamp's [Timestamp Microservice Challenge](http://www.freecodecamp.com/challenges/timestamp-microservice), made using Node.js. 

The project should meet the following requirements: 

> User Story: I can pass a string as a parameter, and it will check to see whether that string contains either a unix timestamp or a natural language date (example: January 1, 2016).

> User Story: If it does, it returns both the Unix timestamp and the natural language form of that date.

> User Story: If it does not contain a date or Unix timestamp, it returns null for those properties.

This is currently still a work in progress, but it *is* progressing... if rather slowly.
